# Political-Ideology-OECD
This analysis examines the evolution of political ideologies in advanced democracies over the past two centuries. It investigates whether polarization and ideological extremism are indeed rising dangerously in modern societies, as some argue, and engages with classical concerns—such as those of Plato—regarding the tendency of democracies to decay into tyranny or demagoguery. By systematically coding and aggregating the political representation of major ideological families, this study provides a global perspective on the historical trajectory of the ideological "status quo" over time, offering insights into both stability and shifts in the balance of political power.
